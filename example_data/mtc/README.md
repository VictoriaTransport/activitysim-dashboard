# MTC example data

The Base and Project outputs were generated using the MTC prototype model version [7da9d6d6d](https://github.com/ActivitySim/activitysim-prototype-mtc/tree/7da9d6d6deca670cc4701fea749a270ab6fe77aa).

The Base scenario consists of 4,500 households randomly sampled from the full population, whereas the Project scenario includes the full population of 5,000 households.

Note that, `skims.parquet` files were converted outside of ActivitySim. The first two columns are origin and destination, then all the columns that come after are the matrices in the `skims.omx` file.
